## üöß Building from Source

Solar Tweaks is fully open-source, allowing you to download the source code and customize it as you like.

### üîß How to Build

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theawesomeyopro1/Solar-Tweaks.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd Solar-Tweaks
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

For development with hot reload:

To create a production build (executables, installers, etc. will be generated in the `dist` folder):

```bash
npm run build
```

## üõ† Troubleshooting

If you get the error:

```
error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
```

Run this before any `npm run` commands:

**On Windows (Command Prompt):**
```bash
set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

**On Linux/macOS (bash/zsh):**
```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

## üì¶ Installing from Releases

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: They may work on Linux and macOS with compatibility layers like Wine, but this isn‚Äôt officially supported.

1. Install Lunar Client from the official Lunar Client website.
2. Download the following files from the Solar Tweaks release page:
   - `solar-engine.jar`
   - `config.json`
   - Solar Tweaks setup executable
3. Run the Solar Tweaks setup executable to create the Solar Tweaks folder inside your Lunar Client directory:

```plaintext
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.lunarclient
```

4. Copy `solar-engine.jar` and `config.json` into the `solartweaks` folder inside `.lunarclient`.
